# news-headline-analysis
This project was completed as part of Assignment 2 for the subject IFQ619 Data Analytics for Strategic Decision Makers.
This analysis used a collection of 1,244,184 news headlines from the ABC between 2003 and 2021 to examine the concerns of the Australian public over time.  
The topics that dominated the headlines for a given year were determined using Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and word frequency techniques in Python.
